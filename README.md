# Personal Portfolio - Jomari Alang

Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is my first ever portfolio website for potential employers. The portfolio highlights several of my side projects, as well as a short information about myself, my coding skills and several of personal about me such as the languages that I learned, a bit of information about myself, and contact information.

## UX

The main target audience of this portfolio are employers, as well as charities, event planners, students and other web developers.

## Technologies

- [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)

  - HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).

- [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

  - Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)

  - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing

* All of the links are working.
* The images adjusts depending on the width  of the view port.
* During my first testing session, I discovered that the project section has uneccessary padding on mobile version.
* The contact page does not allow for the user to submit if the email is not provided.
* The website is validated in [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) and there are no error found.
## Deployment

The repository for this project contains two branches. The first one is called WIP which is short for working in progress. This branch contains all the initial codes that I have implemented. I am still experimenting on the number and name of my branches that I use.

I have deployed the website on Github Pages on the domain name called jomarialang.net. 


### Media

- The photos used in this site were all edited using Photoshop by myself.
